## ðŸ§  7-Step Marketing Analytics Process

### 1. Business Problem Understanding:
The Chief Marketing Officer aims to shift from targeting periodic "big spenders" to a more data-driven segmentation strategy to boost engagement and conversion through customized marketing campaigns.

### 2. Data Understanding and Collection:
Data was sourced from the `ClusterData` dataset provided in the `MKTG525`library. It contains basic behavioral and demographic attributes of online shoppers.

### 3. Data Preparation and Feature Selection:
- Outliers were removed using the IQR method on Annual Income.
- Data was standardized using `PROC STDIZE` to bring all features into the same range.
- Final variables used: `Age`, `Annual_Income`, `Spending_Score`.

### 4. Modeling Development:
- K-Means Clustering was performed for values of K from 3 to 7.
- The clustering was repeated using `PROC FASTCLUS`.
- Metrics used for evaluation: R-Squared, Final Seed Standard Deviation, and Pseudo F Statistic.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:
- The best number of clusters was determined to be **K = 7**, based on:
  - Highest R-Squared (~0.7575),
  - Lower final seed variance (~0.13),
  - Competitive Pseudo F (~3784).
- Final cluster assignments were appended to the original (cleaned) data.

### 6. Model and Results Communication:
- Summary statistics were calculated for each cluster using `PROC MEANS`.
- Clusters were interpreted based on demographic and behavioral patterns to inform targeted marketing strategies.

### 7. Model Deployment:
- Results can be used to design tailored campaigns for each segment.
- Clustering pipeline can be automated in SAS for regular customer analysis.
